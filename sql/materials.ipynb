    "### 1. Introduction to SQL\n",
    "- **What is SQL?**\n",
    "  - SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for managing and manipulating databases.\n",
    "  - SQL is used to query, insert, update, and delete database records.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Basic SQL Commands\n",
    "- **SELECT**: Used to fetch data from a database.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **WHERE**: Used to filter records.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **INSERT INTO**: Used to insert new records into a table.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2);\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **UPDATE**: Used to modify existing records in a table.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **DELETE**: Used to delete records from a table.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Advanced SQL Commands\n",
    "- **JOIN**: Used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.\n",
    "  - **INNER JOIN**: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT columns FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT columns FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all records from the right table and the matched records from the left table.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT columns FROM table1 RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - **FULL JOIN**: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT columns FROM table1 FULL JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Aggregation Functions\n",
    "- **COUNT()**: Returns the number of rows that match a specified condition.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **SUM()**: Returns the total sum of a numeric column.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **AVG()**: Returns the average value of a numeric column.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **MIN()**: Returns the smallest value of the selected column.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT MIN(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **MAX()**: Returns the largest value of the selected column.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Grouping and Sorting\n",
    "- **GROUP BY**: Used to arrange identical data into groups.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT column1, COUNT(column2) FROM table_name GROUP BY column1;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **HAVING**: Used to filter records that work on aggregated data.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT column1, COUNT(column2) FROM table_name GROUP BY column1 HAVING COUNT(column2) > 1;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **ORDER BY**: Used to sort the result set in ascending or descending order.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name ORDER BY column1 ASC;\n",
    "  SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name ORDER BY column1 DESC;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Subqueries\n",
    "- A subquery is a query within another query.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT column1 FROM table_name WHERE column2 = (SELECT column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition);\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)\n",
    "- **WITH**: Used to define a CTE.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  WITH cte_name AS (SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition)\n",
    "  SELECT * FROM cte_name WHERE condition;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Window Functions\n",
    "- **ROW_NUMBER()**: Assigns a unique number to each row within a partition.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT column1, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY column2 ORDER BY column3) AS row_num FROM table_name;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **RANK()**: Assigns a rank to each row within a partition.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT column1, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY column2 ORDER BY column3) AS rank FROM table_name;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **DENSE_RANK()**: Similar to RANK() but without gaps in ranking.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT column1, DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY column2 ORDER BY column3) AS dense_rank FROM table_name;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Practical Examples for Data Science\n",
    "- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**\n",
    "  - Understanding data distribution:\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT column1, COUNT(*) AS count FROM table_name GROUP BY column1 ORDER BY count DESC;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - Finding missing values:\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT column1, SUM(CASE WHEN column2 IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_count FROM table_name GROUP BY column1;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering**\n",
    "  - Creating new features:\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT column1, column2, (column3 + column4) AS new_feature FROM table_name;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. SQL Practice Resources\n",
    "- Online platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/database/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql), and [Mode Analytics](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/introduction-to-sql/) offer SQL practice problems specifically designed for data analysis and data science.\n",
