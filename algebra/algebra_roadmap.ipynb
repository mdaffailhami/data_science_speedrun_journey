    "### 1. Variables and Expressions\n",
    "- **Variables:** Symbols used to represent unknown values (e.g., $x$, $y$).\n",
    "- **Expressions:** Combinations of variables and numbers using operations (e.g., $2x + 3$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Operations with Algebraic Expressions\n",
    "- **Addition/Subtraction:** Combine like terms (e.g., $2x + 3x = 5x$).\n",
    "- **Multiplication:** Distribute and multiply coefficients (e.g., $2(x + 3) = 2x + 6$).\n",
    "- **Division:** Simplify expressions by dividing coefficients (e.g., $\\frac{6x}{3} = 2x$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Equations and Inequalities\n",
    "- **Equations:** Statements that two expressions are equal (e.g., $2x + 3 = 7$).\n",
    "- **Solving Equations:** Isolate the variable (e.g., $2x + 3 = 7 \\rightarrow 2x = 4 \\rightarrow x = 2$).\n",
    "- **Inequalities:** Statements that compare expressions (e.g., $2x + 3 < 7$).\n",
    "- **Solving Inequalities:** Similar to solving equations, but with special rules for multiplying/dividing by negative numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intermediate Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Polynomials\n",
    "- **Definition:** Expressions with multiple terms (e.g., $3x^2 + 2x - 5$).\n",
    "- **Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of polynomials.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Factoring\n",
    "- **Greatest Common Factor (GCF):** Factor out the largest common factor (e.g., $6x^2 + 9x = 3x(2x + 3)$).\n",
    "- **Trinomials:** Factoring expressions like $x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)$.\n",
    "- **Difference of Squares:** Factoring expressions like $x^2 - 9 = (x + 3)(x - 3)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Rational Expressions\n",
    "- **Simplifying:** Reduce fractions to simplest form (e.g., $\\frac{6x}{9} = \\frac{2x}{3}$).\n",
    "- **Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of rational expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Quadratic Equations\n",
    "- **Standard Form:** $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.\n",
    "- **Solving Methods:**\n",
    "  - Factoring: $x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 \\rightarrow (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0$.\n",
    "  - Completing the Square.\n",
    "  - Quadratic Formula: $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Functions and Graphs\n",
    "- **Definition:** A function is a relation where each input has a unique output.\n",
    "- **Types of Functions:** Linear, quadratic, exponential, etc.\n",
    "- **Graphing:** Plotting functions on the coordinate plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Systems of Equations\n",
    "- **Solving Methods:**\n",
    "  - Graphing: Finding the intersection of two lines.\n",
    "  - Substitution: Solving one equation for a variable and substituting into the other.\n",
    "  - Elimination: Adding or subtracting equations to eliminate a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Exponents and Logarithms\n",
    "- **Exponents:** Rules for multiplying, dividing, and raising powers to powers.\n",
    "- **Logarithms:** The inverse of exponents, with properties for simplifying expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. Complex Numbers\n",
    "- **Definition:** Numbers in the form $a + bi$, where $i = \\sqrt{-1}$.\n",
    "- **Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of complex numbers."
