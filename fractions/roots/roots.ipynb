    "In mathematics, a \"root\" refers to a solution of an equation. More specifically, itâ€™s a value that, when substituted into the equation, makes the equation true.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Roots\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Square Root**:\n",
    "   - The square root of a number $ x $ is a value $ y $ such that $ y^2 = x $. For example, the square root of 9 is 3 because $ 3^2 = 9 $. This is denoted as $ \\sqrt{9} = 3 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Note: $ \\sqrt{x} = \\sqrt[2]{x} $\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cube Root**:\n",
    "   - The cube root of a number $ x $ is a value $ y $ such that $ y^3 = x $. For example, the cube root of 27 is 3 because $ 3^3 = 27 $. This is denoted as $ \\sqrt[3]{27} = 3 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **n-th Root**:\n",
    "   - More generally, the n-th root of a number $ x $ is a value $ y $ such that $ y^n = x $. For example, the 4th root of 16 is 2 because $ 2^4 = 16 $. This is denoted as $ \\sqrt[n]{16} = 2 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: $ \\sqrt[n]{x} = x^\\frac{1}{n} $\n",
    "\n",
    "**For examples:**\n",
    "- $ \\sqrt{4} = \\sqrt[2]{4} = 4^\\frac{1}{2} $\n",
    "- $ \\sqrt[3]{27} = 27^\\frac{1}{3} $\n",
    "\n",
    "### Roots in Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Polynomial Roots**:\n",
    "  - For a polynomial equation like $ P(x) = 0 $, the roots are the values of $ x $ that satisfy this equation. For example, for the quadratic polynomial $ x^2 - 4 = 0 $, the roots are $ x = 2 $ and $ x = -2 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Root of a Function**:\n",
    "  - The root of a function $ f(x) $ is the value of $ x $ where $ f(x) = 0 $. For example, if $ f(x) = x - 5 $, the root is $ x = 5 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Principal Root**:\n",
    "  - When dealing with roots (like square roots), there are usually two possible values (one positive and one negative). The principal root refers to the non-negative root.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roots are fundamental in algebra, calculus, and various other areas of mathematics, and they are used to solve equations, analyze functions, and more.\n"
