You'll see some examples of this later in the lesson._)  \n",

    "Depending on how we plan to use this new function `get_pay_with_more_inputs()`, it can be more useful than the original function `get_pay()`, because it addresses more cases.  Instead of potentially incorrectly assuming the hourly wage and tax bracket, the new function allows the user to specify the correct values.  But, if you're sure the hourly wage and tax bracket won't need to change, the new function is just more complicated than necessary.  In general, when defining functions, you'll need to consider how much flexibility you need, based on your use case. \n",
