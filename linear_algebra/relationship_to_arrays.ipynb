    "1. **Scalars (0-D Tensors)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A single value or number.\n",
    "   - Example: $ 5 $\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Vectors (1-D Tensors)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A one-dimensional array of numbers.\n",
    "   - Example: $ [1, 2, 3] $\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Matrices (2-D Tensors)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A two-dimensional array of numbers arranged in rows and columns.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "     1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n",
    "     4 & 5 & 6\n",

    "4. **Higher-Dimensional Tensors (3 or higher dimensional Tensors)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Tensors that extend beyond two dimensions are called higher-dimensional tensors. They include 3-D tensors and tensors with even more dimensions.\n",
    "   - For example, a 3-dimensional tensor can be thought of as a \"stack\" of matrices.\n",
    "   - Example of a 3-D tensor with dimensions $ 2 \\times 3 \\times 4 $:\n",

    "- **Scalars** are 0-dimensional tensors.\n",
    "- **Vectors** are 1-dimensional tensors.\n",
    "- **Matrices** are 2-dimensional tensors.\n",
    "- **Higher-Dimensional Tensors** extend these concepts to 3 or more dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding tensors as multi-dimensional arrays helps in fields like data science and machine learning, where complex data structures are common.\n"
