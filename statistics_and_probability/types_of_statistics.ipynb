    "Descriptive statistics help us summarize and describe the main features of a dataset. They tell us what the data looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Measures of Central Tendency:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Mean:** The average of the numbers.\n",
    "   - **Median:** The middle value when the numbers are sorted.\n",
    "   - **Mode:** The most common value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Measures of Spread:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Range:** The difference between the highest and lowest values.\n",
    "   - **Variance:** How spread out the numbers are.\n",
    "   - **Standard Deviation:** How much the values typically differ from the mean.\n",
    "   - **Interquartile Range (IQR):** The range of the middle half of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Shape of the Data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Skewness:** If the data is lopsided.\n",
    "   - **Kurtosis:** If the data has heavy tails or is flat-topped.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visualizations:**\n",
    "   - **Histograms:** Bar charts showing the frequency of values.\n",
    "   - **Box Plots:** Shows the distribution based on quartiles.\n",
    "   - **Bar Charts, Pie Charts, Scatter Plots:** Various ways to visualize the data.\n"

    "\n",
    "   - **Point Estimation:** A single number estimate of a population parameter.\n",

    "\n",
    "   - **Null Hypothesis (H0):** A statement that there is no effect or difference.\n",
    "   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** A statement that there is an effect or difference.\n",
    "   - **p-Value:** The probability that the observed data would occur if the null hypothesis were true.\n",
    "   - **Significance Level (Î±):** The threshold for deciding whether to reject the null hypothesis, often set at 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Regression Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Linear Regression:** Finding the relationship between two continuous variables.\n",
